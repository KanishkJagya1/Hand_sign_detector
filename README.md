## Introduction

The Hand Sign Recognition Tracker is an innovative project aimed at making video conferences more inclusive for the deaf and dumb community. This project utilizes computer vision and OpenCV to recognize hand signs made by users during video conferences, helping them communicate effectively. The primary goal is to enable real-time translation of hand signs into text or gestures, making communication smoother and more accessible.

## Features

- **Real-time Hand Sign Recognition:** The tracker can recognize and interpret hand signs in real-time during video conferences.

- **Text Conversion:** Converts recognized hand signs into text, allowing users to read what is being communicated.

- **Gesture Integration:** Future scope includes integrating recognized gestures to provide more interactive features in video conferences.

- **Easy Integration:** Can be integrated into popular video conferencing platforms like Google Meet.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you'll need to install the necessary dependencies and set up the environment.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KanishkJagya1/openCV-project.git
   ```

2. Install the required libraries and dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## How to Use

1. Launch the application, which will activate your computer's camera.

2. Start a video conference on platforms like Google Meet.

3. Make hand signs in front of the camera, and the tracker will recognize and convert them into text or gestures.

4. Enjoy more inclusive and effective communication during video conferences!

## Future Scope

The future of this project is exciting, with several potential enhancements:

- **Gesture Integration:** Recognize and interpret gestures to provide interactive features during video conferences.

- **Compatibility:** Expand compatibility to other video conferencing platforms to reach a wider audience.

- **Improved Accuracy:** Enhance the accuracy and speed of hand sign recognition.
